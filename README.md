Online Death Counter - Lets your online friends know when something's not right

In this modern age of online communication, it is so easy to get to know people and keep in touch.
However, it is not if something bad happens to you.

Ping is an online Death counter that allows users to send "Heartbeat" messages to the server to let it know they're still alive.
If the time between two heartbeats becomes too big (for example the user specified a treshold of 5 days, and he's away for 6), a warning goes off.
The user can specify several tresholds (for example 5 days, 10 days, 2 weeks), and actions connected to those tresholds.

The goal of this project is to make the Ping Server broadcast messages to your friends to warn them about your possible demise.
Several options will be offered, like IRC, twitter, facebook, etc.
