Online Death Counter - Lets your online friends know when something's
 not right

In this modern age of online communication, it is so easy to get to
 know people and keep in touch.
However, it is not if something bad happens to you.

Ping is an online Death counter that allows users to send "Heartbeat"
 messages to the server to let it know they're still alive.
A warning is sent to the user when his death date approaches. This is to
 prevent people from forgetting to check in, and accidentally get marked
 as dead.

The goal of this project is to make the Ping Server broadcast messages
 to your friends to warn them about your possible demise.
Several options will be offered, like XMPP, IRC, twitter, facebook, etc.
